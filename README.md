# 🎯 Touch-Free Control for Any App – Just Your Hand Gestures! ✋🖥️

I'm excited to share a fun weekend project I built: a **Gesture-Controlled Assistant** that lets you scroll and zoom on any screen — LinkedIn, YouTube, PDFs, Word Docs, you name it — no mouse or keyboard needed!

---


## ✨ Features

📸 Uses **your webcam + hand gestures** to control your system:

- 👆 **1 Finger** → Continuous Scroll Down  
- ✌️ **2 Fingers** → Continuous Scroll Up  
- 🖖 **4 Fingers** → Zoom In  
- 🖐️ **5 Fingers** → Zoom Out  

💡 Additional Highlights:

- ✅ Compatible with almost any window or app  
- 🎯 Uses **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI**  
- 🧠 Gesture memory with optional **sassy voice reactions** 😄  
- 📄 Lightweight, real-time, and surprisingly practical  
- ♿ Useful for accessibility and productivity
